SUMMARY
---

I am a Senior Developer specialized in React, C#.NET, and Oracle, with strong expertise in software architecture and delivering robust solutions across healthcare, real estate, and mobile applications. Throughout my career, I have worked on both critical system maintenance and scalable new implementations, always striving for quality, innovation, and performance.

My core practices include Clean Code, SOLID, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), unit and integration testing, as well as experience in Hexagonal Architecture and microservices. I also work with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), automated pipelines, Docker for containerization, and DevOps best practices. I have hands-on experience with AWS, leveraging cloud services to build scalable, resilient, and secure solutions.

Currently, I am a Senior Developer at Benner, working on high-impact projects in the healthcare sector, ensuring the modernization and reliability of mission-critical systems.

I am always seeking new challenges, applying modern technologies, SaaS, cloud, and architectural best practices to build scalable, resilient, and high-performance applications.
